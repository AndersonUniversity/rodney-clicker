# **CPSC 4430: Software Engineering Final Project - Rodney Clicker**

Welcome to our Software Engineering final project. We call this final project Rodney Clicker, based off the popular web game and app, Cookie Clicker. Our class designed ours to be centered around Anderson University where we attend school at.

This game is a simple clicker game that allows the user to click on a button to gain points. The user can then use these points to purchase upgrades to increase the amount of points they gain per click. The game is designed to be simple and easy to play, and is meant to be a fun way to pass the time.

We had a few in the scope of programming languages when creating this game, we could've used either Kotlin or Java. Ultimately, we created this game in Android Studio using _Kotlin_ as our programming language as it had better functionality overall with more possibilities in the future. We used the _Android Studio IDE_ to create the game, and used _Git_ and _GitHub_ to collaborate on the project. In addition, we also used _Discord_ to communicate with each other and keep track of our progress, and used a webhook to monitor GitHub processes such as checks passing, pull requests being merged, files being pushed.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project was to create a simple game that could be played on a mobile device. We wanted to create a game that was simple to play, but also had a lot of depth to it. We wanted to create a game that was fun to play, and that could be played for a long period of time. We wanted to create a game that was easy to understand, and that was easy to play. We wanted to create a game that was fun to play, and that was fun to play with friends.

We chose Android devices because not everyone had a Mac computer so we could not create an iPhone game easily without excessive costs. We chose Android because it is the most popular mobile operating system, and it is the most popular mobile operating system for a reason. It is easy to use, and it is easy to develop for. 

## Challenges

While creating this project we encountered several challenges. The first of which was getting Android Studio setup and selecting either Java or Kotlin as our programming language. We chose Kotlin because we liked how Kotlin was set up for future programming and it would add features that felt years ahead of Java. It also was the chosen language by Jetbrains, the creators of Android Studio, so we felt it would be the best choice for us. 

The second challenge we encountered was settling upon a formatter that could be used for syntax and code style. We did some investigation and settled upon Ktlint which was an extension on the Android Studio IDE. This allowed us to have a consistent code style throughout the project.

## How to Play

To play the game, you must either have an Android device or you must be running an Android Emulator that is connected through Android Studio. Once you have downloaded the game, you can open it and begin playing. The game is very simple to play, all you have to do is click on the button in the middle of the screen to gain points. You can then use these points to purchase upgrades to increase the amount of points you gain per click. You can also use these points to purchase buildings to gain points automatically.
