# **CPSC 4430: Software Engineering Final Project - Rodney Clicker**

Welcome to our Software Engineering final project. We call this final project Rodney Clicker, based off the popular web game and app, Cookie Clicker. Our class designed ours to be centered around Anderson University where we attend school at.

This game is a simple clicker game that allows the user to click on a button to gain points. The user can then use these points to purchase upgrades to increase the amount of points they gain per click. The game is designed to be simple and easy to play, and is meant to be a fun way to pass the time.

We had a few in the scope of programming languages when creating this game, we could've used either Kotlin or Java. Ultimately, we created this game in Android Studio using _Kotlin_ as our programming language as it had better functionality overall with more possibilities in the future. We used the _Android Studio IDE_ to create the game, and used _Git_ and _GitHub_ to collaborate on the project. In addition, we also used _Discord_ to communicate with each other and keep track of our progress, and used a webhook to monitor GitHub processes such as checks passing, pull requests being merged, files being pushed.

## How to Play

To play the game, you must either have an Android device or you must be running an Android Emulator that is connected through Android Studio. Once you have downloaded the game, you can open it and begin playing. The game is very simple to play, all you have to do is click on the button in the middle of the screen to gain points. You can then use these points to purchase upgrades to increase the amount of points you gain per click. You can also use these points to purchase buildings to gain points automatically.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. In the next unit, we'll learn CSS frameworks that can expedite our development process.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS, and version control as we add JavaScript, servers, and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.
